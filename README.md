Neural networks semester project

> The task is to train an ML system to generate a drum rhythm that a human listener finds â€¦ well, at least, "interesting". This task can be tackled in various degrees of sophistication. Good human drummers generate amazingly complex drum patterns. Simple versions of the task are quite easily doable, whereas at the high quality end, even current advanced professional music modelling hits limits. This task invites to use recurrent neural networks, but other kinds of models can also be used.

## Getting started

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```


Install dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
```
